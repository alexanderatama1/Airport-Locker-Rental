# Airport-Locker-Rental
This app simulates an airport locker rental system through a console interface. Users can view locker contents, rent lockers to store items, end locker rentals, list all locker contents, and quit the program. The code utilizes an array to represent 100 lockers, with basic validation and user prompts for interacting with the locker system.
